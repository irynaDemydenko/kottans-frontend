# Kottans Frontend 2022 course. Stage0. My way.

## General
<details><summary>0. Git Basics :white_check_mark:</summary>
Well, this module took more time for learning than I expected. It's absolutely new subject for me. Therefore I passed the whole course on Coursera with enthusiasm.
![Cource Certificate](https://github.com/irynaDemydenko/kottans-frontend/blob/d31c94bbb9c15e5c5c80784edea7baf577ce8188/Git_GitHub/Coursera%20ZD5HTUWCA5DC_page-0001.jpg).
The fourth week was harder than the previous 3, because this an advanced level.
I did a big cheat-sheet with all commands I've learnt in this course.
"Learn Git Branching" gave me better awareness about Git and GitHub workflows.

But even after these two courses I have many questions left: how I can use all these commands in real life?
Additional materials for this module helped me to understand subject better. In particular "Communicating using Markdown" was very useful for me.
