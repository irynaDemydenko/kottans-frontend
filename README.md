# General

## **0.** Git Basics
Well, this module took more time for learning than I expected. It's absolutely new subject for me. Therefore I passed the whole course on Coursera with enthusiasm.
I did a big cheat-sheet with all commands I've learnt in this course.  
"Learn Git Branching" gave me better awareness about Git and GitHub workflows.
But even after these two courses I have many questions left: how I can use all these commands in real life?
Additional materials for this module helped me to understand subject better. In particular "Communicating using Markdown" was very useful for me.

## **1.** Linux CLI and Networking
Despite the fact that I used Linux (Ubuntu) before, I did not know 2/3 commands from this course. Most of all I liked the information, how to change permissions for files and folders for different categories of users. Long ago I wanted to understand it.  
I was also very interested in the possibilities of commands with concatenation and pipe. I do not know yet how I will use this in the frontend but it is really interesting.  
As for me, it is very valuable that you have added a lot of good additional materials in this course. I found many answers to my questions there. I put off some of them for later, because I am afraid that I never will go so far to study the coding :laughing:

## **2.** VCS (hello gitty), GitHub and Collaboration
I was very impressed with the ability to move around the branch using the combined instructions for HEAD, like HEAD~^2~2. Also it was interesting to work with fakeTeamwork operations.  
I am not sure yet that I will cope with the solution of complicated conflicts. I hope to better understand this issue in practice.  
I use Git for this course through Git Bash and make commits for all the changes so far. I've done all folders for screenshots not in GUI, but through Git Bash. Very satisfied with myself :laughing:

# Front-End Basics
## **3.** Intro to HTML & CSS
It was easy to learn this module because I have already known the biggest part of html tags and css styles. But it was very important for me to systemize all my knowledge and learn some aspects deeper. For instant, I have finally figured out with video and audio tags, with vertical collapse and some attributes for forms. Also I liked explanation about weight of id, class, attributes and tags in css, about overflow, display and position properties. The most off all I liked quizzes and projects on Codeacademy courses. Also I enjoyed "Can't Unsee" webapp. It is really brilliant and useful!

## **4.** Responsive Web Design
On this step I did my first real site layout. I used flex technology to optimize my work. It's very comfortable.
I have really enjoyed Grid GArden and Flex Froggy games.
Levels 26 and 28 in Grid Garden game were very difficult for me. Flex Froggy was easier to understand.
